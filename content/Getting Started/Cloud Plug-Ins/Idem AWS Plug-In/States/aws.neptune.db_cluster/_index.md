**Autogenerated function**

The DeleteDBCluster action deletes a previously provisioned DB cluster. When you delete a DB cluster, all
automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the
specified DB cluster are not deleted. Note that the DB Cluster cannot be deleted if deletion protection is
enabled. To delete it, you must first set its DeletionProtection field to False.

Args:
    name(str): An Idem name of the resource.
    resource_id(str, optional): An identifier of the resource in the provider. The DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster to be deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.
        Idem automatically considers this resource being absent if this field is not specified.
        Constraints:   Must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.
    skip_final_snapshot(bool, optional):  Determines whether a final DB cluster snapshot is created before the DB cluster is deleted. If
        true is specified, no DB cluster snapshot is created. If false is specified, a DB cluster
        snapshot is created before the DB cluster is deleted.  You must specify a
        FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier parameter if SkipFinalSnapshot is false.  Default: false. Defaults to None.
    final_db_snapshot_identifier(str, optional):  The DB cluster snapshot identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot created when
        SkipFinalSnapshot is set to false.   Specifying this parameter and also setting the
        SkipFinalShapshot parameter to true results in an error.  Constraints:   Must be 1 to 255
        letters, numbers, or hyphens.   First character must be a letter   Cannot end with a hyphen or
        contain two consecutive hyphens. Defaults to None.
    timeout(Dict, optional): Timeout configuration for create/update of AWS DB Cluster.
        * create (Dict) -- Timeout configuration for creating DB Cluster
            * delay -- The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts.
            * max_attempts -- Customized timeout configuration containing delay and max attempts.
        * update (Dict) -- Timeout configuration for updating DB Cluster
            * delay -- The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts.
            * max_attempts -- Customized timeout configuration containing delay and max attempts.

Returns:
    Dict[str, Any]

Examples:

    .. code-block:: sls

        resource_is_absent:
          aws_auto.neptune.db_cluster.absent:
            - resource_id: value

**Autogenerated function**

Creates a new Amazon Neptune DB cluster. You can use the ReplicationSourceIdentifier parameter to create the DB
cluster as a Read Replica of another DB cluster or Amazon Neptune DB instance. Note that when you create a new
cluster using CreateDBCluster directly, deletion protection is disabled by default (when you create a new
production cluster in the console, deletion protection is enabled by default). You can only delete a DB cluster
if its DeletionProtection field is set to false.

Args:
    name(str): An Idem name of the resource. This also maps to db_cluster_identifier while creating the cluster.
    resource_id(str, optional): An identifier of the resource in the provider, this also maps to db_cluster_identifier during update. Defaults to None.
    availability_zones(List, optional): A list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in the DB cluster can be created in. Defaults to None.
    backup_retention_period(int, optional): The number of days for which automated backups are retained. You must specify a minimum value of
        1. Default: 1 Constraints:   Must be a value from 1 to 35. Defaults to None.

        Amazon Neptune will not create a database in the DB cluster you are creating. Defaults to None.
    db_cluster_identifier(str): The DB cluster identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string. Constraints:   Must
        contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.   First character must be a letter.   Cannot
        end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.   Example: my-cluster1.
    db_cluster_parameter_group_name(str, optional):  The name of the DB cluster parameter group to associate with this DB cluster. If this argument
        is omitted, the default is used. Constraints:   If supplied, must match the name of an existing
        DBClusterParameterGroup. Defaults to None.
    vpc_security_group_ids(List, optional): A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB cluster. Defaults to None.
    db_subnet_group_name(str, optional): A DB subnet group to associate with this DB cluster. Constraints: Must match the name of an
        existing DBSubnetGroup. Must not be default. Example: mySubnetgroup. Defaults to None.
    engine(str): The name of the database engine to be used for this DB cluster. Valid Values: neptune.
    engine_version(str, optional): The version number of the database engine to use for the new DB cluster. Example: 1.0.2.1. Defaults to None.
    port(int, optional): The port number on which the instances in the DB cluster accept connections.  Default: 8182. Defaults to None.
    preferred_backup_window(str, optional): The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled
        using the BackupRetentionPeriod parameter. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random
        from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Region. To see the time blocks available, see
        Adjusting the Preferred Maintenance Window in the Amazon Neptune User Guide.  Constraints:
        Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi.   Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).   Must not
        conflict with the preferred maintenance window.   Must be at least 30 minutes. Defaults to None.
    preferred_maintenance_window(str, optional): The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time
        (UTC). Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi  The default is a 30-minute window selected at random
        from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Region, occurring on a random day of the week. To
        see the time blocks available, see  Adjusting the Preferred Maintenance Window in the Amazon
        Neptune User Guide.  Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun. Constraints: Minimum
        30-minute window. Defaults to None.
    replication_source_identifier(str, optional): The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB instance or DB cluster if this DB cluster is
        created as a Read Replica. Defaults to None.
    tags(Dict or List, optional): Dict in the format of {tag-key: tag-value} or List of tags in the format of
        [{"Key": tag-key, "Value": tag-value}] to associate with the DB cluster.
        Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. Defaults to None.
        * Key (str, optional): The key of the tag. Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode
            characters. May not begin with aws:.
        * Value(str, optional): The value of the tag. Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 256
            Unicode characters.
    storage_encrypted(bool, optional): Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted. Defaults to None.
    kms_key_id(str, optional): The Amazon KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster. The KMS key identifier is the Amazon
        Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are creating a DB cluster with the same
        Amazon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can
        use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key. If an encryption key is not
        specified in KmsKeyId:   If ReplicationSourceIdentifier identifies an encrypted source, then
        Amazon Neptune will use the encryption key used to encrypt the source. Otherwise, Amazon Neptune
        will use your default encryption key.   If the StorageEncrypted parameter is true and
        ReplicationSourceIdentifier is not specified, then Amazon Neptune will use your default
        encryption key.   Amazon KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon account. Your
        Amazon account has a different default encryption key for each Amazon Region. If you create a
        Read Replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another Amazon Region, you must set KmsKeyId to a KMS
        key ID that is valid in the destination Amazon Region. This key is used to encrypt the Read
        Replica in that Amazon Region. Defaults to None.
    enable_iam_database_authentication(bool, optional): If set to true, enables Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for the
        entire DB cluster (this cannot be set at an instance level). Default: false. Defaults to None.
    enable_cloudwatch_logs_exports(List, optional): The list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to CloudWatch Logs. Defaults to None.
    deletion_protection(bool, optional): A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has deletion protection enabled. The database
        can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection is
        enabled. Defaults to None.
    source_region(str, optional): The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster. Defaults to None.
    apply_immediately(bool, optional): A value that indicates whether the modifications in this request and any
                                       pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible,
                                       regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the DB cluster.
                                       If this parameter is disabled, changes to the DB cluster are applied during
                                       the next maintenance window.
                                       The ApplyImmediately parameter only affects the
                                       EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication,MasterUserPassword and NewDBClusterIdentifier
                                       values.If the ApplyImmediately parameter is disabled, then changes to the
                                       EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication,MasterUserPassword and NewDBClusterIdentifier
                                       values are applied during the next maintenance window. All other changes are
                                       applied immediately,regardless of the value of the ApplyImmediately parameter
    cloudwatch_logs_export_configuration(Dict[str, Any], optional): The configuration setting for the log types to be enabled
    for export to CloudWatch Logs for a specific DB cluster.
        * EnableLogTypes (List[str], optional): The list of log types to enable.
        * DisableLogTypes(List[str], optional): The list of log types to disable.
    db_instance_parameter_group_name(Text, optional): The name of the DB parameter group to apply to all instances of
                                                     the DB cluster.
    allow_major_version_upgrades(bool, optional): A value that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed.
