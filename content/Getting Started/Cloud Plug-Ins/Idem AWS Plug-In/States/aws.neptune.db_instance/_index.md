**Autogenerated function**

The DeleteDBInstance action deletes a previously provisioned DB instance. When you delete a DB instance, all
automated backups for that instance are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance
to be deleted by DeleteDBInstance are not deleted.  If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon
Neptune DB instance is deleting until the DB snapshot is created. The API action DescribeDBInstance is used to
monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled or reverted once submitted. Note that when a
DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of failed, incompatible-restore, or incompatible-network, you
can only delete it when the SkipFinalSnapshot parameter is set to true. You can't delete a DB instance if it is
the only instance in the DB cluster, or if it has deletion protection enabled.

Args:
    name(str): An Idem name of the resource.
    resource_id(str): AWS Neptune DBInstanceIdentifier to identify the resource. This parameter isn't case-
        sensitive. Idem automatically considers the resource being absent if resource_id is not specified.
        Constraints:   Must match the name of an existing DB instance.
    skip_final_snapshot(bool, optional):  Determines whether a final DB snapshot is created before the DB instance is deleted. If true is
        specified, no DBSnapshot is created. If false is specified, a DB snapshot is created before the
        DB instance is deleted. Note that when a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of
        'failed', 'incompatible-restore', or 'incompatible-network', it can only be deleted when the
        SkipFinalSnapshot parameter is set to "true". Specify true when deleting a Read Replica.  The
        FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier parameter must be specified if SkipFinalSnapshot is false.  Default:
        false. Defaults to None.
    final_db_snapshot_identifier(str, optional):  The DBSnapshotIdentifier of the new DBSnapshot created when SkipFinalSnapshot is set to false.
        Specifying this parameter and also setting the SkipFinalShapshot parameter to true results in an
        error.  Constraints:   Must be 1 to 255 letters or numbers.   First character must be a letter
        Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens   Cannot be specified when deleting
        a Read Replica. Defaults to None.
    timeout(Dict, optional): Timeout configuration for deleting of AWS DB Instance.
        * delete (Dict) -- Timeout configuration for deleting DB Instance
            * delay -- The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts.
            * max_attempts -- Customized timeout configuration containing delay and max attempts.

Returns:
    Dict[str, Any]

Examples:

    .. code-block:: sls

        resource_is_absent:
          aws.neptune.db_instance.absent:
            - name: value
            - resource_id: value

Returns information about provisioned instances, and supports pagination.  This operation can also return
information for Amazon RDS instances and Amazon DocDB instances.

Following sensitive parameters are part of present but are not available as part of describe:
- master_user_password
- tde_credential_password
Following parameter is not part of present and is ignored from describe,
idem ensures that the status is in ready state before declaring the resource present:
- db_instance_status

Returns:
    Dict[str, Any]

Examples:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ idem describe aws.neptune.db_instance

        is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see CreateDBCluster. Default: false. Defaults to None.
    kms_key_id(str, optional): The Amazon KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB instance. The KMS key identifier is the Amazon
        Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are creating a DB instance with the same
        Amazon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB instance, then you
        can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KM encryption key. Not applicable. The KMS
        key identifier is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see CreateDBCluster. If the
        StorageEncrypted parameter is true, and you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter,
        then Amazon Neptune will use your default encryption key. Amazon KMS creates the default

        CloudWatch Logs. For example, arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. If MonitoringInterval is
        set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a MonitoringRoleArn value. Defaults to None.
    domain_iam_role_name(str, optional): Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to the Directory Service. Defaults to None.
    promotion_tier(int, optional): A value that specifies the order in which an Read Replica is promoted to the primary instance
        after a failure of the existing primary instance.  Default: 1 Valid Values: 0 - 15. Defaults to None.
    timezone(str, optional): The time zone of the DB instance. Defaults to None.

    deletion_protection(bool, optional): A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database
        can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection is
        disabled. See Deleting a DB Instance. DB instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when
        deletion protection is enabled in their parent DB cluster. Defaults to None.
    apply_immediately(bool, optional): Specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the DB instance.
        If this parameter is set to false , changes to the DB instance are applied during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can cause an outage and are applied on the next call to RebootDBInstance , or the next failure reboot.
        Default: false
    allow_major_version_upgrade(bool, optional): Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
    ca_certificate_identifier(str, optional): Indicates the certificate that needs to be associated with the instance.
    cloudwatch_logs_export_configuration(dict, optional): The configuration setting for the log types to be enabled for export to CloudWatch Logs for a specific DB instance or DB cluster.
        EnableLogTypes (list) -- The list of log types to enable. (string)
        DisableLogTypes (list) -- The list of log types to disable. (string)
        eg: {
            'EnableLogTypes': [
                'string',
            ],
            'DisableLogTypes': [
                'string',
            ]
        }
        This parameter is most useful while modifying the resource as during create, we may just want to use 'enable_cloudwatch_logs_export' parameter to just enable some log types.
        However, if this parameter is specified during creation of resource, idem will create and update the resource.
    timeout(Dict, optional): Timeout configuration for create/update of AWS DB Instance.
        * create (Dict) -- Timeout configuration for creating DB Instance
            * delay -- The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts.
            * max_attempts -- Customized timeout configuration containing delay and max attempts.
        * update (Dict) -- Timeout configuration for updating DB Instance
            * delay -- The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts.
            * max_attempts -- Customized timeout configuration containing delay and max attempts.

Returns:
    Dict[str, Any]

Examples:

    .. code-block:: sls

        resource_is_present:
            aws.neptune.db_instance.present:
