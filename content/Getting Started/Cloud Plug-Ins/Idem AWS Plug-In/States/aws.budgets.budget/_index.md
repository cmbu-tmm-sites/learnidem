        set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC. If you chose MONTHLY, Amazon Web Services set your
        start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC. If you didn't specify an end date, Amazon Web Services set
        your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC. The defaults are the same for the Billing and Cost
        Management console and the API.  You can change either date with the UpdateBudget operation.
        After the end date, Amazon Web Services deletes the budget and all the associated notifications
        and subscribers.
        * Start (datetime, optional): The start date for a budget. If you created your budget and didn't specify a start date, Amazon
            Web Services defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or
            ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY, and didn't
            set a start date, Amazon Web Services set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC. If you chose
            MONTHLY, Amazon Web Services set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC. The defaults are the
            same for the Billing and Cost Management console and the API. You can change your start date
            with the UpdateBudget operation.
        * End (datetime, optional): The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date, Amazon Web Services set your end
            date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC. The defaults are the same for the Billing and Cost Management
            console and the API. After the end date, Amazon Web Services deletes the budget and all the

            operation.
    auto_adjust_data (Dict[str, Any], optional):: The parameters that determine the budget amount for an auto-adjusting budget.
        * AutoAdjustType (str):-- [REQUIRED] The string that defines whether your budget auto-adjusts based on historical or forecasted data.
        * HistoricalOptions (Dict[str, Any], optional): -- The parameters that define or describe the historical data that your auto-adjusting budget is based on.
            * BudgetAdjustmentPeriod (Integer) -- [REQUIRED] The number of budget periods included in the moving-average calculation that determines your auto-adjusted budget amount.
                The maximum value depends on the TimeUnit granularity of the budget:
                For the DAILY granularity, the maximum value is 60 .
                For the MONTHLY granularity, the maximum value is 12 .
                For the QUARTERLY granularity, the maximum value is 4 .
                For the ANNUALLY granularity, the maximum value is 1 .
            * LookBackAvailablePeriods (Integer) -- The integer that describes how many budget periods in your BudgetAdjustmentPeriod are included in the calculation
                of your current BudgetLimit. If the first budget period in your BudgetAdjustmentPeriod has no cost data, then that budget period isn’t included in the average
                that determines your budget limit. For example, if you set BudgetAdjustmentPeriod as 4 quarters, but your account had no cost data in the first quarter,
                then only the last three quarters are included in the calculation. In this scenario, LookBackAvailablePeriods returns 3. You can’t set your own LookBackAvailablePeriods.
            The value is automatically calculated from the BudgetAdjustmentPeriod and your historical cost data.
    notifications_with_subscribers(List[Dict[str, Any]], optional): A notification that you want to associate with a budget. A budget can have up to five notifications,
        and each notification can have one SNS subscriber and up to 10 email subscribers. If you include notifications and subscribers in your CreateBudget call,

            * ComparisonOperator (str) -- [REQUIRED] The comparison that's used for this notification.
            * Threshold (float) -- [REQUIRED] The threshold that's associated with a notification. Thresholds are always a percentage, and many customers find value being
                alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount. The maximum limit for your threshold is 1,000,000% above the budgeted amount.
            * ThresholdType (str) -- The type of threshold for a notification. For ABSOLUTE_VALUE thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are
                forecasted to go over your total cost threshold. For PERCENTAGE thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a
                certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dollars and you have a PERCENTAGE threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Services notifies
                you when you go over 160 dollars.
            * NotificationState (string) -- Specifies whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget notification is in the ALARM state, you passed the set threshold for the budget.
