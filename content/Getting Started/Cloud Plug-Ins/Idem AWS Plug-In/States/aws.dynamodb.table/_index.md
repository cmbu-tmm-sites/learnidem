**Autogenerated function**

The DeleteTable operation deletes a table and all of its items. After a DeleteTable request, the specified table
is in the DELETING state until DynamoDB completes the deletion. If the table is in the ACTIVE state, you can
delete it. If a table is in CREATING or UPDATING states, then DynamoDB returns a ResourceInUseException. If the
specified table does not exist, DynamoDB returns a ResourceNotFoundException. If table is already in the
DELETING state, no error is returned.   DynamoDB might continue to accept data read and write operations, such
as GetItem and PutItem, on a table in the DELETING state until the table deletion is complete.  When you delete
a table, any indexes on that table are also deleted. If you have DynamoDB Streams enabled on the table, then the
corresponding stream on that table goes into the DISABLED state, and the stream is automatically deleted after
24 hours. Use the DescribeTable action to check the status of the table.

Args:
    name(string): The name of the Idem state.
    resource_id(string, optional): The name of the Dynamodb table. Idem automatically considers this resource being absent if this field is not specified.
    timeout(Dict, optional): Timeout configuration for create/update/deletion of AWS DynamoDB Table.
        * delete (string) -- Timeout configuration for deletion of a DynamoDB Table
            * delay -- The amount of time in seconds to wait between attempts.
            * max_attempts -- Customized timeout configuration containing delay and max attempts.

**Autogenerated function**

The CreateTable operation adds a new table to your account. In an Amazon Web Services account, table names must
be unique within each Region. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create the tables in
different Regions.  CreateTable is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a CreateTable request, DynamoDB
immediately returns a response with a TableStatus of CREATING. After the table is created, DynamoDB sets the
TableStatus to ACTIVE. You can perform read and write operations only on an ACTIVE table.  You can optionally
define secondary indexes on the new table, as part of the CreateTable operation. If you want to create multiple
tables with secondary indexes on them, you must create the tables sequentially. Only one table with secondary
indexes can be in the CREATING state at any given time. You can use the DescribeTable action to check the table
status.

Args:
    name(string): A name of the table to create.
    resource_id(string, optional): The name of the Dynamodb table.
    attribute_definitions(List[Dict[str, Any]]): An array of attributes that describe the key schema for the table and indexes.
        * AttributeName (str): A name for the attribute.
        * AttributeType (str): The data type for the attribute, where:
            S - the attribute is of type String
            N - the attribute is of type Number
            B - the attribute is of type Binary
    key_schema(List[Dict[str, Any]]): Specifies the attributes that make up the primary key for a table or an index. The attributes in
        KeySchema must also be defined in the AttributeDefinitions array. For more information, see Data
        Model in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
        Each KeySchemaElement in the array is composed of:
            AttributeName - The name of this key attribute.
            KeyType - The role that the key attribute will assume:
                HASH - partition key
                RANGE - sort key
        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term "hash attribute" derives from the DynamoDB usage of
        an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their
        partition key values. The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term
        "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key
        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.  For a simple primary key
        (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with a KeyType of HASH. For a composite
        primary key (partition key and sort key), you must provide exactly two elements, in this order:
        The first element must have a KeyType of HASH, and the second element must have a KeyType of
        RANGE. For more information, see Working with Tables in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
        * AttributeName (str): The name of a key attribute.
        * KeyType (str): The role that this key attribute will assume:
                HASH - partition key
                RANGE - sort key
            The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term "hash attribute" derives
            from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across
            partitions, based on their partition key values. The sort key of an item is also known as its
            range attribute. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the
            same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.
    billing_mode(string, optional): Controls how users are charged for read and write throughput and how they manage
        capacity.
            PROVISIONED - AWS recommends using PROVISIONED for predictable workloads. PROVISIONED sets the billing
                        mode to Provisioned Mode.
            PAY_PER_REQUEST - AWS recommends using PAY_PER_REQUEST for unpredictable workloads. PAY_PER_REQUEST
                        sets the billing mode to On-Demand Mode .
    global_secondary_indexes(List, optional): One or more global secondary indexes (the maximum is 20) to be created on the table.

                range attribute. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the
                same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.
        * Projection (Dict[str, Any]): Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the global secondary
            index. These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are
            automatically projected.

            Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
            * ReadCapacityUnits (int): The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a
                ThrottlingException. For more information, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the
                Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. If read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value is set
                to 0.
            * WriteCapacityUnits (int): The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException.
                For more information, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the Amazon DynamoDB

        * Projection (Dict[str, Any]): Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from the table into the local secondary index.
            These are in addition to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are
            automatically projected.
            * ProjectionType (str, optional): The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

        * Enabled - Indicates whether the point in time recovery is enabled or not for the specified table.
    provisioned_throughput(Dict, optional): Represents the provisioned throughput settings for a specified table or index. The settings can
        be modified using the UpdateTable operation.  If you set BillingMode as PROVISIONED, you must
        specify this property. If you set BillingMode as PAY_PER_REQUEST, you cannot specify this
        property. For current minimum and maximum provisioned throughput values, see Service, Account,
        and Table Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. Defaults to None.
        * (ReadCapacityUnits): The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second before DynamoDB returns a
            ThrottlingException. For more information, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the
